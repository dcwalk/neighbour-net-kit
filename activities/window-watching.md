# NNK Activity: Window Watching

## What you'll need

- Community Network Field Book
- Pencils
- Electrical Tape or Masking Tape

## What to do

1. Pick 1 or 2 windows in your place that have the busiest view, if you have windows that face your neighbours you may want to use one of those.
2. Optional: Use tape to split your window into a grid of 4-6 squares
3. Spend a few minutes recording some initial notes in your field book. Things that are helpful to note:
  - If you can see (have "line of sight") any neighbours buildings or windows
  - If there are any obstructed sections
  - If you can see the street from your window!
4. Check back throughout the day and note down anything that strikes you, including changes to obstructions.
