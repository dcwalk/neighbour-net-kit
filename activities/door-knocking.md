# NNK Activity: Door Knocking

## What you'll need

- Community Network Field Book
- Pencils
- Kit Guide Zine Handout

## What to do

1. Get a clipboard--or not--and copy out "Door Knocking Handouts" from this zine.
2. Adapt the questions* and opening script
3. Now (the hard part)...go around your apartment building, block, and/or neighbourhood, and knock on your neighbours' doors!
4. Record the contact info for people interested in joining a network or sharing internet access!

### Questions

About internet access:
1. How do you feel about the current pricing of high-speed internet?
2. Would you be interested in reducing the cost by sharing internet access with nearby neighbours?

About neighbour networks:
1. Would you be interested in joining a locally-run and maintained neighbourhood network to access the internet?
2. If there were a local network, are there any online services (e.g. event listings?) or local activities you could imagine you'd wanting to use or know about?

## Additional Ideas

- Set up (or join) the mailing list or SMS/chat/messenger group for your block or apartment. This doesn't have to be just for sharing internet! Options are free services and involved services that many people use already.
